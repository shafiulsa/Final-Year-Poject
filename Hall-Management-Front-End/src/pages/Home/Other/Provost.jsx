It is my great pleasure to welcome you to Sheikh Rasel Hall, one of the prominent residential halls of Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University (MBSTU). Named in memory of Sheikh Russel, the youngest son of the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, our hall stands as a symbol of discipline, dedication, and academic excellence.

</br> At Sheikh Rasel Hall, we strive to foster a nurturing environment that promotes not only academic growth but also moral values, leadership, and community living. Our goal is to ensure a secure, inclusive, and student-friendly atmosphere where every resident can thrive and fulfill their potential.

</br> As the Provost, I am committed to maintaining a healthy residential life, resolving student concerns, and upholding the traditions of this esteemed institution. I believe that with mutual respect, cooperation, and a focus on education, our students will emerge as responsible citizens and future leaders of the nation.

I encourage all students to take full advantage of the facilities, respect the rules of the hall, and actively participate in co-curricular and cultural activities. Together, let us build a hall community that reflects the values of harmony, respect, and progress.

Thank you for being a part of Sheikh Rasel Hall.

Warm regards,
Dr. Md. Abu Rashed
Provost
